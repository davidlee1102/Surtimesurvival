Hung Le Nhat - University of Surrey

### Supervised/ Instructed by:

- Dr. Eng-Jon Ong
- Prof. Miroslaw Bober

University of Surrey - United Kingdom
__________
The project will be released in September - 2023

__________
This repository provide the implementation of SurvTimesurvival and our result that prove our performance

----------

### How to install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidlee1102/Surtimesurvival.git
```

### Setup evironment

- Install conda software, which can be found at: `https://www.anaconda.com/`
- Import survtimesurvival.yml to conda
- Use this bash

```bash
conda activate survtimesurvival
```

#### OR

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install from requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### After that there are some experiments we have proposed inside the tutorial, because of targeting to deal with covariate data, we almost target to PBC2 data

----------
We announced our research and compared with another paper
