Hung Le Nhat - University of Surrey

### Supervised/ Instructed by:

- Dr. Eng-Jon Ong
- Prof. Miroslaw Bober

The project will be released in September - 2023

__________
This repository provide the implementation of SurvTimesurvival and our result that prove our performance

----------
How to install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidlee1102/Surtimesurvival.git
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### After that there are some experiments we have proposed inside the tutorial, because of targeting to deal with covariate data, we almost target to PBC2 data


----------
We announced our research and compared with another paper
